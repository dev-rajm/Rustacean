# Rust Practice Programs 🦀

Welcome to my **Rust Practice Programs** repository! 🎉

This repository contains all the Rust programs I created while learning and practicing Rust. Each program organized into its own folder, with a dedicated `README` file to explain its functionality and implementation.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

- Each folder (`program/`) contains:
  - A `main.rs` file: The rust code for that program.
  - A `README.md` file: Documentation specific to the program, explaining its purpose and usage.

## 🪴 How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rajmanna-dev/Rustacean.git
```

2. Navigate to a program folder:

```bash
$ cd Rustacean/guessing_game
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
# Programs includes Cargo.toml
$ cargo run
```

4. Compile and run the program(programs without `Cargo.toml`):

```bash
# Compile the program
$ rustc hello_rust.rs

# Run the program on Linux or MAC
$ ./hello_rust

# Run the program on Windows
>>> .\hello_rust.exe
```
